## Installation and usage
to run the game you need to install unity engine 2021 or later and open the Korama-copy folder as a project then you can run the game within Unity or build it and run it outside

## Contribution
this game was created by Mouhamed Rafed Riahi For HolbertonSchool .

## Why did I choose to work on this project? :
Personally, I’m a gamer so I’m interested in video games and how they work as a project I wanted to create something that relates to me and my hobby plus I wanted to
create my own game and learn how to make them.

## accomplishments:
I’m proud to say I made a very intricate game considering it’s my first time although it’s missing so much still I can consider it a very good leap forward considering I 
made a character that moves freely without bugs, shoots bullets and has decent environment elements, made collectibles, enemies with health and most importantly I made 
an AI that makes enemies follow the player which is triggered at a certain range.

Most difficult technical challenges :
First I tried to implement collectibles to give the player a chance to have another try before the game restarts at the first level but it was super buggy when the 
character passes through the item the counter registers 2 I couldn’t fix the problem so I made the counter into a double variable type and increment it by 0.5 instead of 
an integer this seems to have fixed the problem for now until I find a more sustainable and permanent solution.

Secondly, the AI pathfinder seemed to not work with non-flying enemies so I opted to make ground enemies patrol a certain area instead of following the player.

Lastly, the animation that I used was frame by frame so transitioning between them was a challenge but in the end, I made variables to make the transition and change 
those variables in the player movement script.

## What I’ve learned:
Technically speaking I learned a lot through this project like C# scripting and using Unity engine and editor but most importantly the logic behind making a game. 
Although I might have done some stuff differently like making my own assets and making the game 2.5D. I learned about myself as an engineer that I’m a fast learner and 
hard worker but I’m a perfectionist.

This project will be a big milestone in my engineering career cause it’s my first encounter with C# and Unity engine.

Fun fact I used to think that making logic for a game was hard but I realized designing its elements is harder.
