## Installation and Usage

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Install Unity Engine 2021 or later.
2. Open the `Korama-copy` folder as a project in Unity.
3. You can run the game within Unity or build it to run outside of the Unity environment.

## Contribution

This game was created by Mouhamed Rafed Riahi for Holberton School.

## Why Did I Choose to Work on This Project?

As a passionate gamer, I am deeply interested in video games and their development. This project allowed me to merge my hobby with my studies, giving me the opportunity to create my own game and learn the intricacies of game development.

## Accomplishments

I am proud to have created a detailed and functional game, especially considering it is my first attempt. Here are some of the key features:

- A character that moves freely without bugs
- Shooting mechanics
- Decent environmental elements
- Collectibles and enemies with health systems
- An AI that makes enemies follow the player within a certain range

## Most Difficult Technical Challenges

1. **Implementing Collectibles:**
   - Initial attempts resulted in a bug where the counter registered two increments instead of one. To temporarily fix this, I changed the counter to a double variable type and incremented it by 0.5. I plan to find a more sustainable solution in the future.

2. **AI Pathfinding:**
   - The AI pathfinder did not work well with non-flying enemies. As a workaround, I made ground enemies patrol specific areas instead of following the player.

3. **Frame-by-Frame Animation:**
   - Transitioning between animations was challenging. I resolved this by using variables to manage transitions and updating these variables in the player movement script.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned

Through this project, I have gained significant technical skills, including:

- C# scripting
- Using the Unity engine and editor
- Understanding game logic and development

Moreover, I learned a lot about myself as an engineer. I discovered that I am a fast learner, a hard worker, and a perfectionist. This project marks a significant milestone in my engineering career, being my first encounter with C# and the Unity engine.

### Fun Fact

I used to think that game logic was the hardest part of game development. However, I realized that designing game elements is even more challenging.
